# Vaccine-Usage-analysis-and-prediction

**ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

**1. DATA ENGINEERING:**
  1.Understand the complete dataset and Engineer it as per the needs.
  
  2.Do Exploratory data analysis to get deeper understanding about the  attributes.

**2. DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT:**

  The Plotly or streamlit analytical Dashboard is expected to be developed that has at least 5 types  of dynamic charts and at least 3 data filtering options.

**3. MODEL DEVELOPMENT:**

  Training a Logistic Regression model (or any suitable model)for prediction.
  
  Model tuning and evaluation to improve predictive performance.
  
  Developing a predictive model that can help in targeting vaccination campaigns effectively.
  
  Create a model serving api once the model is ready.
  
  Develop an application using flask or plotly or streamlit that can accept features as input and provide prediction to the end user.
  
  Host the application using any free hosting service provide (example: render.com, pythonanywhere,etc).
